About
=====
The Echo3 File Transfer Library is a collection of Echo3 components to facilitate uploading and downloading of files between the client
and server.

Building
========
To just build the JARs, a few dependencies are required to be present in the lib directory. These are automatically downloaded on your
first run of the Ant build or by manually running the "dependencies" target.

Developing
==========
The project contains a pre-configured IntelliJ IDEA project. Using the Ultimate Edition there are also pre-defined run targets to run
i.e. the test harness application. Same can be achieved using the according Ant tasks to build a WAR and deploy it on any servlet
container of choice.
